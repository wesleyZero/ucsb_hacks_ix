> We believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a valuable and important aspect of education, and it should be carried out with integrity and honesty. Cheating not only undermines the learning process but also diminishes the value of hard work and effort put in by those who strive for academic excellence. We wanted to use new AI capabilities to help the teachers grade work more objectively.

## Description

Cheat Checker is a web-based application that uses computer vision to process the submitted videos from the student during the test-taking. Python model is trained to detect when the student is not looking at the screen and when their gaze is not stable. The less attention they give to their screen, the less percentage they will have. 


### Technologies

- Modified pretrained eye tracking model (Python 2, 3 library), Pytorch, Django framework to connect back-end and front-end, HTML/CSS to write the front-end, Figma and Canva for designing. 


### How to use
- After uploading the video to the webpage, the percentage of screen attention will be calculated and returned to you. A low percentage suggests a higher likelihood of cheating by the user.
